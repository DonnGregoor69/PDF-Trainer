# PDF Trainer

PDF Trainer an interesting package that combines text extraction and machine learning for PDF files. With PDF Trainer, you can extract text from PDF files and use it to train a machine learning model for text classification. This can be useful in many applications, such as document classification, sentiment analysis, and information extraction.

PDF Trainer is built on top of some popular Python libraries, such as PyPDF2 and scikit-learn, which makes it easy to use and extend. PyPDF2 is a library for working with PDF files in Python, and scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that provides a wide range of algorithms for text classification.

PDF Trainer can be useful for anyone who needs to work with PDF files and wants to extract text and use it for machine learning tasks. It can be particularly useful for researchers, developers, and data scientists who work with large volumes of PDF files and need to automate text extraction and classification tasks.

# Here are some usage examples:

Example 1: Extracting text from a single PDF file and training a model

```
from pdf_trainer import PDFTrainer

# Create a PDFTrainer object
trainer = PDFTrainer()

# Extract text from a single PDF file
pdf_file = 'path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf'
text = trainer.extract_text(pdf_file)

# Train a model on the extracted text
labels = ['positive', 'negative']
data = [('This is a positive review.', 'positive'),
        ('This is a negative review.', 'negative')]
trainer.train(text, labels, data)
```

Example 2: Extracting text from multiple PDF files and training a model

```
from pdf_trainer import PDFTrainer

# Create a PDFTrainer object
trainer = PDFTrainer()

# Extract text from multiple PDF files
pdf_dir = 'path/to/your/pdf/directory'
text = trainer.extract_text(pdf_dir)

# Train a model on the extracted text
labels = ['positive', 'negative']
data = [('This is a positive review.', 'positive'),
        ('This is a negative review.', 'negative')]
trainer.train(text, labels, data)
```

Example 3: Using a pre-trained model to classify new text

```
from pdf_trainer import PDFTrainer

# Load a pre-trained model
model_file = 'path/to/your/model/file.pkl'
trainer = PDFTrainer.load(model_file)

# Classify new text
text = 'This is a new document that needs to be classified.'
label = trainer.predict(text)
print(label)
```

These examples are just a starting point, and you can modify them to fit your specific use case. I hope this helps!

## Installation

You can install PDF Trainer using pip:

```
pip install pdftrainer
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use PDF Trainer to extract text from a PDF file and train a machine learning model:

```python
from pdftrainer.extractor import PDFTextExtractor
from pdftrainer.processor import TextProcessor
from pdftrainer.trainer import ModelTrainer

# Extract text from PDF files
extractor = PDFTextExtractor()
texts = extractor.extract_texts(["path/to/file1.pdf", "path/to/file2.pdf"])

# Process extracted text data
processor = TextProcessor()
processed_texts = processor.process_texts(texts)

# Train a machine learning model
trainer = ModelTrainer(model_path="path/to/model")
trainer.train(processed_texts)
trainer.save_model()
```

See the documentation for more detailed usage instructions.

# PDF Text Extraction and Processing

This project contains three Python scripts that extract text from PDF files and process the extracted text.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.6 or later.

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ``````bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Scripts

### PDF Text Extractor

The `pdf_text_extractor.py` script extracts text from one or more PDF files using the `pdfminer` module.

#### Usage

1. Create an instance of the `PDFTextExtractor` class:

   ````python
   from pdf_text_extractor import PDFTextExtractor

   extractor = PDFTextExtractor()
   ```

2. Call the `extract_texts()` method on the `extractor` object with a list of PDF file paths as an argument:

   ````python
   pdf_filepaths = ["path/to/file1.pdf", "path/to/file2.pdf"]
   texts = extractor.extract_texts(pdf_filepaths)
   ```

   The `extract_texts()` method loops over the list of PDF file paths and attempts to extract text from each file using the `_extract_text()` method. If an error occurs while reading a file, a warning is logged and the method moves on to the next file. The extracted texts are stored in a list and returned by the method.

### Text Processor

The `text_processor.py` script processes extracted text data using the `TextProcessor` class.

#### Usage

1. Create an instance of the `TextProcessor` class:

   ````python
   from text_processor import TextProcessor

   processor = TextProcessor()
   ```

2. Call the `process_texts()` method on the `processor` object with a list of extracted texts as an argument:

   ````python
   extracted_texts = ["text1", "text2", "text3"]
   processed_texts = processor.process_texts(extracted_texts)
   ```

   The `process_texts()` method loops over the list of extracted texts and processes each text using the `process_text()` method. If an error occurs while processing a text, the method moves on to the next text. The processed texts are stored in a list and returned by the method.

### Model Trainer

The `model_trainer.py` script trains a machine learning model on processed text data using the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module.

#### Usage

1. Create an instance of the `ModelTrainer` class:

   ````python
   from model_trainer import ModelTrainer

   trainer = ModelTrainer(model_path="path/to/model")
   ```

2. Call the `train()` method on the `trainer` object with a list of processed texts as an argument:

   ````python
   processed_texts = ["text1", "text2", "text3"]
   trainer.train(processed_texts)
   ```

   The `train()` method splits the processed texts into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function. It then builds word vectors, builds a model, and trains the model on the training set.

3. If you need to retrain the model with new data, you can call the `retrain()` method:

   ````python
   trainer.retrain()
   ```

   The `retrain()` method retrains the model with new data.

4. You can save the trained model to the specified path by calling the `save_model()` method:

   ````python
   trainer.save_model()
   ```

   The `save_model()` method saves the trained model to the specified path.

5. If you need to load an existing model, you can call the `load_model()` method:

   ````python
   trainer.load_model()
   ```

   The `load_model()` method loads an existing model from the specified path.

6. You can log the model's performance by calling the `log_performance()` method:

   ````python
   trainer.log_performance()
   ```

   The `log_performance()` method logs the model's accuracy.
